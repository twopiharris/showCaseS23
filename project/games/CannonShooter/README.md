# FinalGame
The main premise of the game will be the user will be trying to move the cannon back and forth along the wall to protect the castle from monsters trying to destroy it. As you continue to protect the castle and kill more monsters you will be able to upgrade the cannon’s damage. The more Monsters that come the harder that they will get as you progress through waves of them. Until you reach the final boss monster which you will need to defeat in order to win the game.  
The Cannon: 

This is the user-controlled sprite 

The basic controls will just be moving back and forth 

Using the left and right arrow or the A and D keys  

Moves the cannon left and right  

In order to shoot you need to use the space bar 

This will fire a cannon ball from the cannon that will continue until it hits an enemy or collides with the top of the screen  

For the upgrades there will be three upgrades  

One for upgrading move speed 

This will add a specific amount to the speed with each upgrade 

One for upgrading damage 

This will increase the damage each cannon ball deals to monsters 

One for upgrading fire rate 

This will allow for the cannon to fire faster 

The way this will work is whatever button is showing will determine what the current state for the cannon is using the visible method  

You will also need to have enough money to be able to buy said upgrade  

The Monsters: 

These are the computer-controlled sprites 

Each one will spawn at a random x value at the top of the screen  

It will then start “falling” towards the wall 

If it collides with the wall, it will take away some of the walls hit points  

If possible, I will allow them to bounce off the wall to get a more consistent hitting mechanic  

Otherwise, I will just have it taking away a very small amount of damage as it is hitting the wall 

Once I get the basic monsters working, I will add new monsters that have different characteristics that will appear as the game progresses 

These monsters included a zombie a slime and a heavy each with different stats 

Zombie  

Medium health 

Medium damage 

Medium speed 

Slime 

Low health 

Low damage 

High speed 

 

Heavy 

High health 

High damage 

Low speed 

There will be a final boss monster that you need to kill in order to win the game  

The Wall: 

This will be a stationary sprite that you are trying to keep the monsters from touching  

It will have a set health value that if it reaches 0 you lose 

Stationary attackers: 

Stretch Goal! 

Did not get too 

Start Screen: 

Have the title  

Have a button that starts and unhides all the starting sprites to begin the game 

Gameplay Screen: 

Title and start button hidden

Quit button: 

Allows the user to quit once they lose 

Start button: 

Appears at the very beginning  

Allows the game to be started  

Restart button: 

Restarts the game from the lost screen 

After completing the game Documentation: 

First things first I feel like I did well here. I did not reach every stretch goal but when looking into all the different ways to upgrade and the auto towers I felt like they would have been quite a stretch for me to get it in the time I had. I was able to get the basic game when as you kill enemies you progress waves and end with a boss to win the game. For some reason my buttons for quitting and resetting were not working at all and I am not sure why. 
All of the Assets of this Game were created by me!
