# CS120Final

There are two games to choose from.
Music Puzzle and Simon Says

Music Puzzle:
  Generates a random 4 note code.
  Notes are only used once in the sequence.
  Use the clues to determine the notes and order need to solve the puzzle.
  You have 3 free attempts before losing on the 4th.

Simon Says:
  There are 4 colored buttons each with its own sound.
  Once you start the trial, it will generate a single code for you to repeat.
  If you guess that correctly, it will get harder by randomly making a new sequence and adding an additional note each time.
  The goal is to keep going until you fail.
  Highscores are kept.

Things I learned:
  How to create a random sequence from a list.
  How to sleep time to space out notes being played.
  Various other techniques learned in class.

Where I got stuck:
  I had to figure out how to generate random solutions for both games. I started with the puzzle game and I was able to find a way to create a 4 note solution, however, this method did not work well with the Simon game since it did not reuse notes. I was able to come up with another solution for this.
  I also got stuck on making lights flicker for my buttons in the Simon game.

What would I like to improve:
  Adding difficulties to both games and increasing speeds to the Simon game.
  Fixing the lights for the Simon game.
  Add new puzzles to the puzzle game.

How would I do things differently:
  Maybe changing the puzzle in the puzzle game.

How far did I stray from the game design document:
  I don't think I strayed too far from the game document. I did find a few things that I overlooked that I had to include or work around.

How did I stay on track:
  I followed my milestones as much as I could.
  I also frequently keep notes on things I need to look at and fix.
