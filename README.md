# arcade cabinet keyboard map

All input should be based on keyboard.  The cabinet will have a mouse and keyboard,
but in gameplay mode, only the mapped keys will be available as joysticks and buttons.
In your instructions, please indicate both a key and a color for buttons, so the 
game can be played on a traditional computer as well as the cabinet.

    EG:  press f or red button for player1 to fire
         press h or red button for player2 to fire

**Left stick** 

              w - up
    a - left     +    d - right
              s - down

**Left Buttons**  

    f (red)  e (white)  
                        q (blue)
    z (yellow) x (green)

**Right Stick**  

              i = up
    j = left    +    l = right
             k = down

**Right Buttons**  

    h (red) u (white)
                    o (blue)
    b (yellow) n (green)
    
**Left side start button**  

    /

**Right side player buttons**

    2 = two players
    1 = one player

Only the keys listed in this mapping will be available during gameplay mode.
Consider adding keypress input in addition to any buttons.  
(If you have a start button, for example, also map it to / so the console start button will work.)
