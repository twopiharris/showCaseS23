# Warriors-Arena

Final Project Created for CS 120

My goals for this project was to make a very simple combat game where you could face off againts a player that you will play with on the same computer. The first player that health gets to zero loses. Each character has the ability to move right,left,jump,hit,and block. The "Talos" character also has one special move. Special moves can only be used three times per round. 

Instructions:
To start the game you will want to run userInterface.py. This will run the start screen. If you just run game.py the game will still run but you won't be able to pick the characters that you want. It will only be running the test code. 

Player 1 Controls: A(Move Right), D(Move left), S(Jump), Q(Block), W(Hit), E(Special move)
Player 2 Controls: J(Move Left), L(Move Right), K(Jump), O(Block), I(Hit) U(Special move)
These controls will also be on the start screen. 

New Technologies Used: 
  1. More complex animations
  2. Test for collisions using hitboxes that track the character's movements.
  3. Using multiple scenes.

My process:

This ended up being a very big project that took me a lot of time to complete. The only way that I was able to stay on track was by having a very detailed progress tracker. In my formal game design document, I had written things that I had to have completed by the end of each day. I ended up working ahead which was really helpful when I got stuck on a few problems. One problem that I got stuck on was the hitbox. Making a hitbox that followed the character's animations proved to be challenging. I spent a lot of time getting a good enough version to be functional. Overall, I am happy with how this project turned out, but there are a few things I would like to improve. One is that it is pretty laggy when the characters are fighting, and the minotaur character's animations are a little messed up. I would also like to figure out a way to work out some of the bugs with my sound effects. In certain instances with multiple sound effects playing sometimes one will not play. Other than those few things, I am happy with how this project turned out, and I don't really think I would have done anything differently if I had to do this project again. When it comes to how close I stayed to my actual design document I would say that I pretty much followed it to a T. I got everything I had planned done. I even had time to complete a majority of my stretch goals as well. In the end, I feel like this was a very challenging project that pushed my skills as a programmer, but I am extremely happy with the results.
