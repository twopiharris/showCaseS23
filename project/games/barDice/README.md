# FinalDice
Summary
	This game is based off of a classic midwest bar dice game.My goals for this project were: to get the dice working and rolling correctly without any problems, Add a score keeper method so it will tell the, add a roll count so the user can't roll as many times as they want, and add a select roll button that allows you to roll certain die. I also added multiple screens such as: the intro screen, the player select screen, the main game screen, the next player screen, and the result screen.

Instructions
	 The rules are simple: try to get the most points possible. Your points are calculated by taking the highest number of dice of the same number, multiplying that number by 10, and adding the repeated number, so if you roll three fours, your score is 34. You can select a certain dice by pressing the select button below the dice and this will allow you to reroll it. If you are satisfied with your score you may press the stop button to keep your score.

Techniques and Technologies
	I used many techniques throughout my program including: For Loops, if statements, lists, classes, graphics and multiple things from simpleGE. The technologies I used were simpleGE, spyder, and I used pixlart to make my dice.

Sources 
	I made the Die 
	2DPIXX made the pub background and I shortened the image
	The music Flagonlord was made by Bryan Wysopal
	Both of these were found on opengameart.org

Process
	I learned how to manage my goals better and how helpful documentaion and algorithims can be
	I got stuck in a couple of places the main was figuring out the score correctly and the next biggest was switching the image when the button is pushed
	I would like to fix a bug where if you select a six dice then it will change the image of another dice and increase it's own size
	I would make the score function easier to make 
	I didn't stray too far from it I really used it as a reference to keep track of what I'm doing the most major thing I changed was I added the select buttons instead of allowing the user to click which I think it works better this way.
	I used my game desin a lot to stay on track
